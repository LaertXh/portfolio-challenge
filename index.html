                <p>
                    I am very new to web development. This is a small paragraph to act as a general description about me. It's purpose is to just take up some space on the screen in order to demonstrate what a large portion of text on this website would look like. Whoever is reading this is not falling a sleep, they are just tired. 
                </p>
                <p class="last-paragraph">
                    This is a new paragraph on my description. This new paragraph was shown in the demo for this website so I want to make sure that it is shown here too. The is supposed to be a gap between both paragraphs. This means that we cant place all of our about me text in one paragraph and we need to create a new p element and add spacing with css.
